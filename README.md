# printf
Group project on ALX Software Engineering Programme using C programming Language

Collaborators:  Tshiamo Bokaba and Nwosu Chukwuemeka

This printf project is a collaboration between Tshiamo Bokaba and Nwosu Chukwuemeka who are Software Engineering students of ALG(ALX and Holberton) programme. This project involves a function named "_printf" which would imitate the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. This function contains some of the basic features and functions found in the man 3 of "printf".

**What you would learn from this project:**

--How to use git in a team setting
--Applying variadic functions to big projects
--The complexities of printf
--Managing a lot of flies and finding a good workflow

**General Requirements**

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project

**Authorized functions and macros**
-write (man 2 write)
-malloc (man 3 malloc)
-free (man 3 free)
-va_start (man 3 va_start)
-va_end (man 3 va_end)
-va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
-va_arg (man 3 va_arg)

**Compilation**
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
